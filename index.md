### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because found this lab to be very fun as I always wanted to create some kind of game using code. Though I always thought that it was something that required great experience in programming. This lab showed me how just through if-statements a solid game could be developed.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a great one because it was the first time I was able to see some sort of user input get calculated and returned as an important value. It was very cool to see the computer do all the work for the first time. In previous labs it seemed like user had to do most of the work.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was enjoyable because it showed the importance of formatting when creating if statements. It really forced me to slow down and consider what parameters I needed to set before actually writing my code. I feel like that is a very important thing as you progress in programming.
